/*
Chef has bought a new robot, which will be used for delivering dishes to his customers. 
He started testing the robot by letting it move on a line.

Initially, the robot is placed at the coordinate x=X. 
Then, it should execute a sequence of N commands, described by a string S with length N. 
Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', 
denoting that the robot should walk one step to the left (decreasing x by 1) or to the right (increasing x by 1), respectively.

How many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands?
A point p is visited by the robot if p is an integer and the robot's position before or after executing some command is x=p.

Example Input
2
6 10
RRLLLL
2 0
LL

Example Output
5
3

Explanation
Example case 1: The robot followed the path 10→11→12→11→10→9→8.

Example case 2: The robot followed the path 0→−1→−2.

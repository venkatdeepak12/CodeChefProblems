"It's totally fun to play troublemakers â€• totally." - Lee Pace

Sakshi had a matrix with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). 
Initially, all cells of this matrix contained 0-s. Let's denote a cell in row r and column c by (r,c).

Sakshi is well-known for troubling others. This time, her friends Nikki and Mansi planned to take revenge and teach her a lesson,
so they changed her matrix by performing the following operation Q times:

Choose any valid cell (x,y).
Add 1 to all the cells in row x.
Add 1 to all the cells in column y.

For each valid i, the cell chosen in the i-th operation was (Xi,Yi).
Nikki and Mansi challenged Sakshi to find the number of cells in the resulting matrix which contain odd integers. 
Sakshi is not good at math, since she has spent all her life troubling others, so this time, she really needs your help.
Help Sakshi find the answer.

Example Input
1
2 2 3
1 1
1 2
2 1

Example Output
2

Explanation

Example case 1: After applying the first operation, the matrix becomes:
                   2 1
                   1 0
                After applying the second operation, it becomes:
                   3 3
                   1 1
                Finally, after applying the third operation, it becomes:
                   4 3
                   3 2

/*
Guddu likes a girl that loves playing with numbers. She agreed to go on a date with Guddu, but only if he can solve the following problem:

An integer is round if it is greater than 0 and the sum of its digits in decimal representation is a multiple of 10. 
Find the N-th smallest round integer.

However, Guddu does not like playing with numbers at all and he is unable to solve this problem, 
so he begs you to solve it for him. In return, he will definitely give you a treat.

Example Input
1
2

Example Output
28

Explanation
Example case 1: The smallest round integer is 19 and the second smallest is 28

//CODE:
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 
  
int main() 
{ long long t,n,m,sum,rem;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        cin>>n;
        sum=0;
        m=n;
        while(m!=0)
        {
            sum+=m%10;
            m/=10;
        }
        rem=sum%10;
        
        if(rem==0)
        {
            cout<<n<<"0"<<endl;
        }
        else{
        rem=10-rem;
        cout<<n<<rem<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0; 
}

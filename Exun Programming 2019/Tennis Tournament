/*

A tennis tournament is about to take place with N players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. 
That is, every match has a winner and a loser.

With Naman's birthday approaching, 
he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.

Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

Sample Input:
2
3
2

Sample Output:
YES
010
001
100
NO

Explanation:
One such scenario for N = 3 is when player 1 beats player 2, player 2 to beats player 3 and player 3 beats player 1.
Here all players win exactly 1 match.

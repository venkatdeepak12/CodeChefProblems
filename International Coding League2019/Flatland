/*
In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation.
So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. 
He starts with N Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles.
He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side S requires S2 Circles to create.
Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.

Sample Input:
2
85
114

Sample Output:
2
4

/*
Due to Walter's work schedule, there is tension between Walter and Skyler, which in turn is leading to divorce.
Skyler being the mother of his newborn child has custody of them and does not allow Walter to come to her daughter-holly's birthday.

Walter hires Mehul for the job. (Assume the cake to be a circle, with centre as point A). 
There are some rules regarding cake cutting.

First Skyler chooses two points (B and C) on the circumference of the cake and cuts a piece joining the two points
with another point D on the circumference, as shown in the image. After this Mehul has to cut a new cake through the same two points
(B and C), and the center A. Thus joining point B with A and point C with A as shown in this image.

You will be given the angle BDC cut by Skyler. Help Mehul find the angle of his piece of cake for Walter to enjoy his daughter's birthday.

Sample Input:
30

Sample Output:
60

EXPLANATION:
Angle of Skyler's piece (ie angle BDC) is 30 deg so the angle at centre will be 60 deg.

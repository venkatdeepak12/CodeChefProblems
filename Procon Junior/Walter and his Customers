/*
Walter is the best in making crystals and due to which his crystalâ€™s popularity grew. 
It grew so much that it was not enough for everyone.

So Jesse gave a unique number to all the customers and thought
that whose number is divisible by 2 and by 3 are eligible to buy their product.
But if the unique number is divisible by 5, then that customer is not eligible to buy his product.

Walter and Jesse appoint Madhav to sell the product. When the customer comes to buy the product,
they show their unique number and then Madhav accordingly decides whether to sell him or not. A customer can come any number of time.

Print the total number of different customers who are eligible.

Sample Input:
5
2 3 6 30 10

Sample Output:
1

/*
There are N caves in a row, numbered 1 through N.
For each valid i, the radiation power in the i-th cave is Ci. Originally, the radiation level in each cave was 0.
Then, for each valid i, the radiation power in cave i increased the radiation levels in the caves i−Ci,…,i+Ci inclusive
(if they exist) by 1, so all the caves are radioactive now.
Radiation is not the only problem, though.
There are also N zombies with health levels H1,H2,…,HN.
You want to kill all of them by getting them to the caves in such a way that there is exactly one zombie in each cave.
A zombie dies in a cave if and only if the radiation level in that cave is equal to the health level of the zombie. 
Is it possible to kill all the zombies?

Example Input
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 4 5

Example Output
NO
YES

Explanation
In both example test cases, the final radiation levels in the caves are (5,5,4,4,3).
For example, the radiation power in cave 1 increased the radiation levels in caves 1 and 2 (there is no cave 0) by 1,
and the radiation power in cave 4 increased the radiation levels in all caves by 1.

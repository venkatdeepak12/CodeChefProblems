/*
The Students of Tritvi College are shifting to their new hostels at Sabar.

Since Sabar is a little far away from GEC where they usually go for studying, and Infocity, where they go for shopping; 
they decide that in order to visit all of them in a single day, 
they would first go to GEC from Sabar and then later, from GEC to Infocity and then back to Sabar from Infocity.
The students know the distance a between GEC and Infocity, and the distance b between Infocity and Sabar.
Help them find the maximum possible distance c and the minimum possible distance d between Sabar and GEC 
when it is known that all the three destinations do not lie on a single straight road.

Sample Input:
1
2 2

Sample Output:
3 1

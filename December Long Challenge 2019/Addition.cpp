Recently, Chef studied the binary numeral system and 
noticed that it is extremely simple to perform bitwise operations like AND, XOR or bit shift on non-negative integers,
while it is much more complicated to perform arithmetic operations (e.g. addition, multiplication or division).

After playing with binary operations for a while, 
Chef invented an interesting algorithm for addition of two non-negative integers A and B:

function add(A, B):
    while B is greater than 0:
        U = A XOR B
        V = A AND B
        A = U
        B = V * 2
    return A
Now Chef is wondering how fast this algorithm is. 
Given the initial values of A and B (in binary representation),
he needs you to help him compute the number of times the while-loop of the algorithm is repeated.

Example Input
3
100010
0
0
100010
11100
1010


Example Output
0
1
3


Explanation
Example case 1: The initial value of B is 0, so while-loop is not performed at all.

Example case 2: The initial values of A and B are 02=0 and 1000102=34 respectively.
                When the while-loop is performed for the first time, we have:

                U=34
                V=0
                A changes to 34
                B changes to 2â‹…0=0
                The while-loop terminates immediately afterwards, so it is executed only once.

Example case 3: The initial values of A and B are 111002=28 and 10102=10 respectively. 
                After the first iteration, their values change to 22 and 16 respectively. 
                After the second iteration, they change to 6 and 32, and finally, after the third iteration, to 38 and 0.

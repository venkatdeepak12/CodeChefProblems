/*
Barney is a rich lad who lives in an awesome place called Puzzles. 
Barney likes to show off his wealth by carrying a fully stuffed wallet. 
But the truth is, he only carries 10 rupee notes to make his wallet look big. 
One day he goes on a coffee with his crush Robin. While trying to impress her,
he decided to make the full payment himself. He tried to pay the entire bill with those 10 rupee notes. 
Since this was an awesome place, if Barney paid anything in multiple of 100 or 1000, 
the 10 rupee notes would combine to make one single 100 or 1000 rupee note.

The paid amount must be greater than or equal to the bill incurred. 
Now Barney wants to maximize the number of notes he gives and not spend too much at the same time.
But he is terrible at maths. So, as a divine follower of brocode, he needs your help in impressing his crush.

Sample Input:
2
11
98

Sample Output:
20
110

EXPLANATION:
For the first case, Barney will give 2 notes of 10 rupees each For the second case, 
if he gives 10 notes, they will combine to form a 100 rupee note, 
hence Barney will have to pay 110 rupees to maximize the number of notes
